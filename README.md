# Ramen-Analysis

##  Inspiration:
I decided to do some EDA with my favorite food: RAMEN. Along with that, I wanted to experiment with some NLP.


## Context:
This data comes from Ramen Rater, which is a product review website for Ramen. The kaggle can be found here, and the actual CSV data can be founded here.

## Here's what I learned.
